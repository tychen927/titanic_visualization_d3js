Dataset used: titanic
Main.html is my final work.
In order for the script to run, you need to change the path for the CSV file.

main_scatter is the previous (incomplete) version of this project. It uses x and y axis to show two correlated dependent vars, and use the color to show the independent vars (y, survival).
 
Design concepts:
- Since "survival" is the most important var in this dataset, I plotted all vars against it
- These 5 vars are the categorical vars, and can be appropriately represented in one single chart
- Using bar chart, which is one of the most commonly used chart, makes it easier for layman to read 

Feedbacks:
1. The previous version (scatterplot) is too hard to read, suggesting a bar chart
-> main_v1 to main_v2
2. Instructor feedback: 
	1) The legend is overlapping with the bar chart
	-> changed!
	2) Can remove the "_ns" and "_s" since it's not necessary
	-> Not changed, see feedback 3
3. It's a bit weird to see two bars having the same name
-> thus I still keep the text, however change the wording to make it clearer
